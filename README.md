## Project
The TK Dev Community project is an initiative to create a safe and engaged community on Discord dedicated to the creation and sale of scripts for the Open Tibia Server (OTS). The aim is to bring together people who are passionate about the world of online gaming and who possess programming skills, to develop content that enhances the OTS player experience.

In addition to offering a secure space for the sale and purchase of OTS scripts, the TK Dev Community aims to build a collaborative and diverse community where members can share ideas, exchange knowledge, and contribute to the development of new content for the server.

By joining the TK Dev Community, you'll have access to a group of highly skilled and experienced individuals who work together to create custom, high-quality scripts for OTS. Community members can share ideas and collaborate on ongoing projects, allowing for the development of creative and innovative solutions.

The TK Dev community is also a great place for learning, as members share their experiences and knowledge in programming, becoming a valuable source of information for beginners and professionals in the field.

If you're a lover of online gaming, especially OTS, and have programming skills, the TK Dev Community is the right place for you. Join us and be a part of an engaged and collaborative community where you can share your knowledge, acquire new skills, and of course, contribute to the development of amazing content for OTS.
